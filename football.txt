Football, known as soccer in some countries, is one of the most popular and widely played sports in the world. Here are some key aspects of football:

Objective: The main objective of football is to score goals by getting a round ball into the opposing team's goal while preventing the opposing team from scoring in your own goal.

Teams: A standard football match is played between two teams, each consisting of 11 players, including a goalkeeper.

Field: Football is typically played on a rectangular field with goalposts at either end. The field is divided into two halves, and there are markings such as the center circle, penalty areas, and the halfway line.

Duration: A standard football match is divided into two halves, each lasting 45 minutes, with a 15-minute halftime interval. Some variations, such as youth or amateur matches, may have shorter game durations.

Scoring: Goals are scored by getting the ball into the opposing team's goal. A goal is worth one point.
